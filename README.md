# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The app allows users to add and delete tasks, and it displays a list of tasks.

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn (depending on your preference)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd todo-app

3. Install the dependencies:
    npm install OR yarn install

4. To start the development server:
    npm run dev OR yarn dev


P.S. It was a great experience to work on this project.
 I’ve been working more closely with Tailwind CSS,
  and I appreciate this opportunity. I haven’t resolved 
  the hydration issue yet, but I’m actively learning 
  how to fix it and will address it as soon as possible.
